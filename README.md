# **AI Feature-Driven Development (AI-FDD)**

AI-FDD is a lightweight blueprint for human–AI co-development within traditional agile theory: humans describe outcomes as small, reviewable features, and AI implements them iteratively. The full theory now lives in [ai-feature-driven-development.md](ai-feature-driven-development.md).

- Human-to-AI instruction dropbox: [instructions/](instructions/)
- Feature index: [features/readme.md](features/readme.md)

## Working Style

- Think in user-facing outcomes, not implementation steps.
- Keep features atomic so AI can deliver in one pass and humans can review in minutes.
- Sync code with feature docs (`features/*.md`, `features/docs/*.md`, `features/apis/*.md`) after changes.
